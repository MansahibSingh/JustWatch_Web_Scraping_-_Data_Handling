# **JustWatch Streaming Data Scraper and Analysis Project**

JustWatch is a widely used platform that aggregates content availability across various streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and others. The objective of this project is to develop a web scraping solution to extract movie and TV show data from JustWatch using Python-based tools.

The data extraction process involves automating browser interactions with Selenium, parsing the page content with BeautifulSoup, and collecting relevant information directly from the website's HTML structureâ€”without utilizing their API endpoints. Key attributes such as title, release year, genre, rating, and availability on streaming platforms are targeted for extraction.

Once the data is collected, it is cleaned, filtered, and analyzed using Pandas to generate meaningful insights. The processed dataset is then exported to a CSV file for further use, reporting, or visualization.

This project demonstrates practical skills in web scraping, data manipulation, and exploratory data analysis, aligning with real-world data collection and processing scenarios.
